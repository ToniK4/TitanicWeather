# TitanicWeather
Description:
This is a semester project we made in the 3rd semester of computer science in zealand.
Our idea was to make a weather application with a Raspberry Pi. The main idea is that we measure data on the pi and send this to a web application using a rest-service.

Functionalities:
When you start the application you can see the home page. On this page you see the current weather, temperature, wind speed and humidity.
